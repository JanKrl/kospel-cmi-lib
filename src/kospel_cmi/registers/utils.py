"""
Low-level utility functions for encoding/decoding heater register formats.

This module handles the conversion between Python data types and the heater's
register format (little-endian hex strings representing signed 16-bit integers).

Important: The bit manipulation functions (get_bit, set_bit) are low-level
utilities and should not be used directly in application code.

    Converts a signed 16-bit integer to the heater's little-endian hex string.

    This is the inverse of reg_to_int(). Converts a Python integer to the format
    expected by the heater API (little-endian hex string).

    Process:
    1. Convert signed int to unsigned 16-bit representation
    2. Format as 4-digit hex string
    3. Swap bytes for little-endian transmission

        215 -> pack as signed -> unpack as unsigned -> 0x00D7 -> "00d7" -> "d700"
